Power Dial (formerly DDPM)
==========================

Generators
----------
Caboose : unimplemented
Rocket  : unimplemented
Bullet  : implemented
Mallard : implemented

Purpose
-------
The Power Dial feature provides a method of scaling down power use in a core without the need for voltage and frequency changes.

Method
------
The following 4b Register defines a series of reduced performance modes to scale power below the normal peak.

| 31:4  | Reserved  | reserved

|       |           | n : Issue rate = n/16 of peak
|===


Description:
------------
When written to a non-zero value, the register causes instruction issue rates per-256-cycle periods to scale at the rates shown to reduce relative power use.  Power is a function of many variables including voltage, frequency, pipeline execution and data, therefore the PowerDial register is only one element of a power management solution.
